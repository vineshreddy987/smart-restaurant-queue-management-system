## Authentication & Security

### JWT Token Management
- Tokens are issued with 24-hour expiration
- Token validation occurs on every protected route
- Expired tokens are automatically rejected with HTTP 401

### Frontend Token Handling
- Token stored in localStorage
- On app load: token is decoded and expiration checked
- Expired tokens are cleared automatically
- Users redirected to login with "Session expired" message

### Auth Guard Protection
- All private routes protected by Angular Route Guards
- Guards verify both token presence AND validity
- Invalid/expired tokens trigger automatic logout

### Session Flow
1. User logs in → JWT issued (24h expiry)
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. On subsequent visits:
   - Token decoded and expiration checked
   - If valid → auto-login allowed
   - If expired → cleared, redirect to login
4. API calls with expired token → 401 → auto-logout

### Logout
- Explicit logout clears token and user data
- Redirects to login page
- Session expired shows friendly message

|--------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Check Tables       | "Is a table available for 4?"        | All            |
| Queue Position     | "What's my queue position?"          | All            |
| Join Queue         | "Add me to the queue for 3 people"   | Customer       |
| Leave Queue        | "Remove me from queue"               | Customer       |
| Make Reservation   | "Book a table for tomorrow at 7 PM"  | Customer       |
| View Reservations  | "Show my reservations"               | All            |
| Cancel Reservation | "Cancel my reservation"              | All            |
| Manager Stats      | "Show today's stats"                 | Manager, Admin |
| Help               | "What can you do?"                   | All            |
### Quick Replies
The chatbot provides context-aware quick reply buttons:
- Dynamically generated based on conversation state
- Time slots shown as clickable buttons (30-min intervals)
- Table numbers shown as quick selection options
- Global actions: Cancel, Help

### Time Slot Selection
- Business hours: 10 AM - 10 PM
- 30-minute intervals
- Past times automatically filtered for same-day bookings
- Validation ensures time is within business hours

### Global Commands
These commands work at any point in the conversation:
- "cancel", "stop", "exit", "start over", "reset", "quit", "nevermind", "abort"

### Chatbot API

```
POST /api/chatbot/message
Body: { "message": "Is a table available for 4?" }
Response: {
  "response": "Great news! I found 2 tables...",
  "intent": "CHECK_TABLE",
  "confidence": 2,
  "data": [...],
  "success": true,
  "quickReplies": ["Table 1", "Table 2", "Cancel"],
  "sessionStep": "AWAITING_TABLE_SELECTION"
}
```

### How It Works

1. User sends a message via the chat widget
2. Session state is retrieved/created for the user
3. Global cancel commands are checked first
4. If in a multi-step flow, context-aware processing occurs
5. Otherwise, intent detection via keyword matching
6. Role-based access control validates permission
7. Intent handler executes business logic
8. Response with quick replies returned to user

### Supported Date/Time Formats

- Dates: "today", "tomorrow", "day after tomorrow", "Friday", "next Monday"
- Times: "7 PM", "7:30 PM", "19:00", "6:30 pm"
- Quick replies: Clickable time slot buttons
